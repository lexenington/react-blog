# My React Blog
<p>This is a First React Project. In this project I created a blog for an African Magazine Company using the react.js.</p>

<p> Every item on the blog is components. For example, the navbar, header content/article and footer are all components. This shows I know how to use props in react</p>

<p>Props are data passed from parent components to child components. In combination with .map() method I took an array of objects and displayed as JSX to rendered on the webpage</p>
